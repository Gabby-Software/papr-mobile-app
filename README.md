## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
1. Run `pod install` to install dependencies.

## ⚙️ Setup
To be able to log in during development, you'll need a Client ID and Client Secret.

To get these, [register](https://unsplash.com/oauth/applications) a new OAuth application on Unsplash.

Make sure the Authorization callback URL is set to `papr://unsplash`. The others can be filled in as you wish.

To add the Client ID and Client Secret to the App, follow these steps:
###
1. In Xcode, go to `Product`> `Scheme` > `Manage Schemes...`
2. Select `Papr` and click `Edit...`
3. Go to `Run` > `Arguments`
4. Add your Client ID (`UNSPLASH_CLIENT_ID` as key) and Client Secret (`UNSPLASH_CLIENT_SECRET`) to the Environment Variables.
